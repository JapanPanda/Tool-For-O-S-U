# Tool-For-O-S-U
Purposely stripped of the other minor files and .dlls in order to compile so that no players can utilize this tool to wreak havoc on osu's highscore. I'm aware its not really open-source, but I do not wish to share a tool that can be used to cheat on an online-multiplayer game. Also, it might have lost its functionality since osu! continually updates its anti-cheat.

Demo of this can be found in this early beta video:
