# Tool-For-O-S-U
In reality, this "tool" is a h _ _ _ or che _ _ for osu! by ppy, but I named this ambiguously so no one can encounter this and misuse it with malicious intent.  


osu! is a game where a player clicks circles to the beat of a song, and requires fast finger skills and hand-eye coordination
This tool can be used to achieve high scores through clicking the circles for you with perfect accuracy while at the same time mimicking a human's movements with delays and "offset" clicks. This makes the player seem legitimate. This program is practically undetectable unless someone decides to achieve insane scores with it. 


Purposely stripped of the other minor files and .dlls in order to compile so that no players can utilize this tool to wreak havoc on osu's highscore. I'm aware its not really open-source, but I do not wish to share a tool that can be used to cheat on an online-multiplayer game. Also, it might have lost its functionality since osu! continually updates its anti-cheat.
